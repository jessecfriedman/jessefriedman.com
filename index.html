              Every marketing project starts with the same three elements:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>audience:</b> who we are talking to</li>
              <li><b>message:</b> what we are saying to them</li>
              <li><b>channels:</b> how we are delivering the message</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With these three parts defined, we plan, build, execute, and measure with confidence and focus. The impact will far outlast my engagement.

              There are many great marketers out there. Here's a few qualities that set me apart:
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Working with experts.</b> Engineers, lawyers, policy wonks: I get along great with them with a balance of curiosity and humility.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Great collab vibes.</b> Most people find me fun to work with. I'm high-energy, empathetic, flexible, I give thorough and supportive notes, and I make people laugh. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Overcoming constraints.</b> Short timelines, regulatory hurdles, and technical challenges are fun challenges to solve. I'm a marketing Macgyver when need be.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Top-notch writing.</b> My copy is crisp and action-oriented, and my blog posts are engaging and accurate.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Candor.</b> I'll tell you straight up if I'm the wrong guy for the job, and politely but clearly if I think you could be doing something differently or better.
            </p>

                VP-level marketing strategy plus effective execution or sub-contracting to get things planned and done without the full-time overhead. Or simply use me for about ten hours a month to get something done, such as competitive analysis or a white-paper series.

                Launching a product? Messaging falling flat? Give me a week or two, and I'll give you a thorough analysis from a product marketing veteran's perspective. I'll outline how to improve things, and either suggest that I do it, or point to someone better suited.

                I've been in your shoes. I know how hard it is to find a writer whose work is both engaging and accurate. Thankfully, you've found me. I'll work by the word or the hour, but you value output, not input, right? My standard is $700 for standard-length blog posts, $1,200 for heftier, and $1,700+ for big ol' pieces.
